        <h1>Wesley Lucas</h1>
        <p><em><a href="https://www.carfind.co.za/">Carfind.co.za</a <strong> Project Manager</strong>. </em></p>
        <p>I am a meticulous detailed and analytical worker with 9 years managerial experience. My leadership role began as an Area Manager contracted to LG Electronics where I was then promoted to National Manager. I was then approached by Samsung
          where I
          maintained the role of Regional Sales Manager for two years contracted through Smollan. Following that I became Head of Retail Operations ESA at Huawei, where I shortly thereafter started a new career path as Project Manager to Carfind
          (Pty) Ltd.
          I currently still reside within Carfind (Pty) Ltd as the Sales and CCR Manager – An online comparative shopping website that targets a unique audience. Through each experience mentioned above, i've obtained a large amount of knowledge and
          skills
          in different industries, cultures and management styles which has grown and developed me not only in a professional but also a personal capacity.
          I have always valued every leadership stage that I have achieved as I have considered such as the foundational opportunity laid for the preceding developmental levels in my career path. Without individually singling out all the attributes
          learnt
          in all the companies I have served, I will only refer to those I consider to have been remarkable. My period of service at Samsung to be specific developed my business skills substantially. The brand is a fast pace and one had to move and
          adjust
          as quickly as the products flew off the shelves. I began to do analysis and trends for the industry (Mobile sector) and presented my findings and recommendations for the region to the retail management and Managing Director of the
          organization.
          Samsung is number driven, therefore I learnt the importance of understanding market related trends and studies, costs, budgets, forecasting, strict deadlines, and how to monitor actual targets in both revenue and units. I became a leader
          and best
          practise ambassador for Samsung such that the company invested in me. I obtained my Retail and Business Management (RMDP) under the company’s financial facilitation. This training empowered me to manage staff such as trainers, salesmen,
          sales
          representatives and field merchandisers for the organization.
          On another hand, my period at Huawei taught me the importance of networking within the organization. Networking is crucial for business growth. Through the company’s support I was enabled to make Huawei hit the Market in 2015 by investing
          aggressively in their Sales field force. Realising such efforts the company promoted me to become the Head of Retail in Eastern and Southern Africa. As a team, we setup field staff consisting of merchandizers, Reps, Trainers, Area Managers,
          Regional Managers, and Retail Managers in each country assigned to us within ESA. After setting up the field force at Huawei Mobile under the guidance of the Sales Director, I was appointed to concentrate on the South African Market. I
          reported
          to the Country Manager and Sales Director. During my time there, this is when Carfind.co.za had approached me. The Managing Director for Carfind.co.za assigned me to run with a new project that had locally and globally patented markets.
          Since
          then, I have been assigned to overlook the sales and retention for the organization and report in relation to growth and short coming obstacles. Core duties is to ensure new business is continuously running while the retention side of the
          business is being serviced and our paying subscribers of fully satisfied with the performance thereof. In light of the above, I have established my passion and career path such that I would like to establish myself and continuously grow
          further.
